MissingOutputException in rule voxelize_cells in file /mnt/c/Users/shil5659/OneDrive - Nexus365/Documents/GitHub/Limeseg_cell_analysis/Snakefile, line 4:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
demo_data/demo_label_image.tif.npz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
